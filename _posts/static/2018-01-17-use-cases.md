### 2.1 User Invitation

To enroll a device, the Administrator must send an enrollment invitation to the email of the owners of the devices with the [MDM Agent](http://flyve.org/android-mdm-agent/) installed, the email contains a Deeplink which has the following information:

* the URL of the backend for REST API requests
* a user API token belonging to a human user account
* an invitation token
* the name of the company's helpdesk
* the phone number of the company's helpdesk
* the website of the company's helpdesk
* the email of the company's

### 2.2 Enrollment

The user must open the email with the invitation from the device to start enrollment, once it is enrolled succesfully a user account is created, the following information is sent to the backend:

* The email address where the invitation was sent
* Invitation token sent in the deeplink
* Phones provided by the user in enrollment
* First Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Last Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Serial of the device
* UUID of the device

#### Flyve MDM Deeplink

Flyve MDM Deeplink, is a microservice that generates a deeplink with the information of the invitation to perform the enrollment of the device.

The deeplink features three ways to display the information to execute the enrollment.

* Email account: when the invitation is opened from the email account of the user in the respective device to enroll, the email will display the deeplink with the information of the invitation encoded. Also the QR code image is attached. After opening the link the MDM Agent will recognize it and start the enrollment.
* QR code display: the deeplink can also be opened in a computer's browser, in this case the deeplink will decode part of the information and display the Helpdesk information and the QR code, so the user can scan it from the MDM Agent and make the enrollment.
* Mobile device browser: in case the invitation is opened with the browser of the device, it will display a button that contains the deeplink so the MDM Agent can recognize it and start the enrollment.

## 3. Device Management
