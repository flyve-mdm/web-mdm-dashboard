The Web Administrative Dashboard of Flyve MDM is a centralised mobile device management tool.

Designed to work with GLPI, it requires the GLPI API Rest with which to save glpi/flyve users.

It allows you to efficiently manage your mobile fleet, provided as a SaaS platform combined with an intuitive and simple user interface our solution lets you take control of your fleets from any web browser.

Through the M2M protocol the Web Dashboard connects to the Agents installed on the devices managed, providing the ability to:

* Control and monitor the security policy
* Configure and deploy your mobile fleet
* Install and uninstall applications remotely
* Send files remotely to all terminals
* User's accounts configuration
* Create an inventory of all of your company terminals (mobile fleet inventory)
* Deploy and control Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity
* Enable and disable camera
* Activate real-time geolocation of your terminals
* Delete, partially or totally, your data in case of loss or theft
